    <h4>When the French explorer Samuel de Champlain visited the American Indians on the eastern shore of Lake Huron in the 1600s, he found them cultivating the common sunflower. The parts of the plant furnished the Indians with a wide variety of useful products.The sunflower is still a commercially valuable plant. The leaves are used as fodder, the flowers yield a yellow dye, and the seeds provide oil and food <br> Native mainly to North and South America, the plant is now also cultivated in Egypt, India, Ukraine, England, and other parts of Europe for its seeds: their sweet, yellow oil is considered to be as good as olive or almond oil for table use. The oil is also used in soap, paints, and stock and poultry feed. The seeds may be eaten dried or roasted or they may be ground to make bread or a coffeelike beverage.</h4>

    ;">Structure : The Sunflower is a giant among flowers. The rough, hairy stem is 3 to 12 feet (1 to 4 meters) tall; the broad, coarsely toothed, rough leaves are 3 to 12 inches (8 to 30 centimeters) long; and the flower heads may be 1 foot (0.3 meter) wide in some cultivated varieties.<br> The flower head is flat, with a brown, yellow, or purple disk framed by numerous yellow ray florets.</p>

    <p style="font-family:Arial Narrow Bold;">The name of the sunflower comes from the way the plant turns its head from east to west to follow the sun. The plant may also be named for the resemblance of its golden-rayed head to the sun. The name sunflower is generally applied to members of the genus Helianthus, in the aster, or daisy, family (Asteraceae). The scientific name of the common sunflower is H. annuus</p>
